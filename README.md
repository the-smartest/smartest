The smartest way to run your tests.

"Insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results." - Author unknown

Then why do we keep wasting our time running the same old unit tests over and over again only to see the same result?

If any of your tests gives you a different result at each run, your test is non-deterministic and therefore it is a bad test.

If not running a subset of your tests break any test, then you need to fix your tests.
